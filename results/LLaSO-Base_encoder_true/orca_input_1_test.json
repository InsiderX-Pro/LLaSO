It is designed with sharp-edged holes or blades that shred the food into small pieces. Therefore, the primary purpose of a grater is to grate food items, and it is commonly used for grating cheese. \n\nOption B) grate metal easily is incorrect because a grater is not designed to grate metal. Grating metal can damage the grater and make it unsafe for food use. \n\nIn summary, a grater is a kitchen tool used to grate food items, and it is best suited for grating cheese and other food items, but not for grating metal."

The new passport is designed to meet international standards and is equipped with advanced security features to prevent fraud and identity theft.\n\nThe new passport is expected to make travel easier and more convenient for Nigerians, as it will allow for faster processing times at immigration checkpoints. It will also enable Nigerians to travel to more countries without the need for a visa, as many countries require a machine-readable passport for visa-free travel.\n\nThe new passport comes in two categories: the 32-page standard passport and the 64-page frequent traveler passport. The standard passport is suitable for individuals who travel occasionally, while the frequent traveler passport is designed for individuals who travel frequently for business or personal reasons.\n\nThe new passport is also equipped with a biometric data page, which contains the holder's personal information, photograph, and fingerprints. This feature will help to prevent identity theft and fraud, as it will be difficult for anyone to impersonate the passport holder.\n\nTo obtain the new passport, Nigerians are required to visit the Nigerian Immigration Service website to complete an online application form. They will then be required to attend an interview at a passport office to provide their biometric data and other necessary documents.\n\nOverall, the introduction of the new machine-readable passport is a positive development for Nigeria, as it will make travel easier and more convenient for Nigerians. It will also help to prevent identity theft and fraud, which is a growing concern in today's digital age."

When particles collide with the walls of the container, they exert a force on the walls, which contributes to the pressure inside the container.\n\nTherefore, if there are fewer particles in the container, there will be fewer collisions with the walls, resulting in a lower overall force exerted on the walls. Consequently, the pressure inside the container will be lower.\n\nIn summary, a container with fewer particles will have a lower pressure because there will be fewer collisions with the walls, leading to a decrease in the overall force exerted on the walls."

First, we need to understand what the man needs the balls of cotton for. If he needs them for medical purposes, such as cleaning a wound or applying medication, then the most likely place to find them would be in a medicine cabinet or first aid kit.\n\n2. If the man does not need the cotton for medical purposes, then we need to consider other options. The option \"pocket\" could be a possibility if the man carries cotton balls with him for personal hygiene or other reasons.\n\n3. The options \"south\" and \"Georgia\" are too broad and do not provide any specific information about where the man could find cotton balls. Therefore, we can eliminate these options.\n\n4. The option \"North Carolina\" is also too broad, but it is worth considering if the man is located in or near North Carolina. North Carolina is known for its cotton production, so it is possible that the man could find cotton balls at a local store or market.\n\n5.

Thirdly, we can infer that \"1634: The Baltic War\" was written before \"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\" since it is mentioned first and is described as being \"preceded by\" the latter book. \n\nAdditionally, we can gather that these books likely belong to a series or collection of related works, given that they are both identified by a year in their titles. The mention of a \"Bavarian Crisis\" also suggests that the books may be historical fiction or alternate history, as they appear to be set in a specific time period and involve political events. \n\nOverall, this sentence provides a brief introduction to two books by David Weber and hints at their genre and subject matter."
