He is best known for his work \"The Communist Manifesto,\" which is considered one of the most influential works in modernist philosophy. Marx believed that the classless state of the proletariat is the only way to achieve true equality and social justice. He also argued that the state should be accountable to its citizens and that the government should be accountable to its people. Marx's ideas have had a profound influence on the development of modern capitalism and the way in which people think about the world."

Conversely, when fuel is consumed less, the engine burns less fuel, which in turn decreases the fuel efficiency. This is why it's important to maintain the proper fuel efficiency levels in a vehicle to ensure optimal performance."
