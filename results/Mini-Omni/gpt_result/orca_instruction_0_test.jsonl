This perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of mitosis. Direct effects could include the failure of the spindle fibers to properly attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes, leading to an inability to separate the sister chromatids. Indirect effects could include the activation of cell cycle checkpoints that would halt the progression of mitosis until the issue is resolved.
