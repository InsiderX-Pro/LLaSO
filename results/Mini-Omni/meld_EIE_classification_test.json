They look at how individuals respond to various stimuli, such as body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. By comparing these responses to a preexisting baseline, researchers can determine if the observed patterns align with the expected outcomes. This helps in understanding the impact of external factors on the individual's emotional state."
