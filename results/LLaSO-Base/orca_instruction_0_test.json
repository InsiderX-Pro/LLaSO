Additionally, sand has a higher coefficient of friction than ice, which means that it creates more resistance when an object tries to move across it.

For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \"intercostal clavicle\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\". Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zoo and, mistaking a dangerous leopard (also portrayed by Nissa) from a nearby circus for Baby, let it out of its cage. contains an answer for the question: Whose tameness is helped by hearing \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\"?, what is it ?\nAnswer:"

Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. Therefore, it follows that cell division, including mitosis, is more complex in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes.\n\nIn eukaryotes, mitosis involves a series of complex steps that ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes. These steps include the condensation of chromosomes, the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, the separation of sister chromatids, and the formation of two new nuclei. In addition, eukaryotic cells also undergo cytokinesis, which is the physical separation of the two daughter cells.\n\nIn contrast, prokaryotic cell division is a simpler process called binary fission. During binary fission, the DNA replicates and the cell divides into two identical daughter cells.

A fully capable LaserDisc playback system includes a newer LaserDisc player that is capable of playing digital tracks, has a digital optical output for digital PCM and DTS audio, is aware of AC-3 audio tracks, and has an AC-3 coaxial output; an external or internal AC-3 RF demodulator and AC-3 decoder; and a DTS decoder.

At room temperature and standard pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid. Snow and ice sublime at temperatures below the melting point of water, a slow process that may be accelerated by winds and the reduced atmospheric pressures at high altitudes. When solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms (Figure 10.27). The reverse of sublimation is called deposition, a process in which gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition.   Q: What is the process by which some solids transition directly into gases?

Therefore, the second sentence, which states that the postal cost is more for full-time employees, is a logical conclusion based on the information provided in the first sentence.

Review: I'm an Elijah fan, so I went out and rented this movie as soon as I found out about it. The plot is pretty interesting, but is drowned out by the movie's overabundant shots of Edward Burns walking dramatically down the street to the movie's redundant soundtrack. I must admit that Burns does a pretty convincing job in his character, although I'm not really sure if that is attributed to his acting or because he may actually be like that, since the last Burns movie I saw was ages ago. Rosario Dawson gives a pretty good performance in this movie, as does Elijah Wood. The only complaint I have about Elijah's performance is that he lacks the tough New York accent that Burns (who plays his brother) has throughout the movie. I'm not sure that if they grew up together, why Burns' character has an accent and Wood's does not. Oh well.\nThe answer to this question is:"

It was quite informative as well as extremely helpful.Pros:The author does a great job trying to articulate his point that the rise in sectarianism is not a product of the 20th century, but instead a product of more recent times. He tries to argue that the blame should be somewhat given to the Western powers for inciting the rise in major clashes between the Christians and the Muslims. The author understands that the Western perspective of Muslims being bad and all. He uses Lebanon to specifically showcase that our truths are in a way overblown.Cons:This book is definitely not for the faint of heart. While good, it can sometimes be convoluted in understanding what is truly going on. Definitely not for someone who has no interest in learning more about Lebanon.

But that's not the case with other celestial objects. Venus has some water, but it is in gaseous state. On the other hand, water in Jupiter's moon Europa is in frozen state.  and a hint : Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100Â°C (212Â°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.  Please answer this question : In Europa would the state of water in higher or lower denstiy than in Earth?\nThe answer is:"

Therefore, the water in Europa would be in a solid state and have a higher density than liquid water on Earth."

The movie is a biographical drama film based on the life of Lillian Roth, an American singer and actress. \n\nNext, I searched for the credits of the movie and found that the song was performed by Susan Hayward, who played the role of Lillian Roth in the movie. Susan Hayward was a talented actress and singer who won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the 1958 movie \"I Want to Live!\".\n\nTherefore, based on my research, I can confidently say that Susan Hayward did the singing in \"I'll Cry Tomorrow.\""

Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there. Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities. At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected. But they don't mind at all. What they do mind is leaving the beauty of the wilderness and the good friends they've made to return to their normal lives in the city. Question: What do the students have to do before dinner? Yes or no, is the answer \"Review what they learn through discussion.\"?\nAnswer:"

One time I get a beautiful widescreen version of \"Pollyanna\", \"Swiss Family Robinson\", and \"The Parent Trap\" and the next time I get this piece of garbage with a disgusting transfer in the hated full screen format. This is not the first time I've been fooled by Disney, but rest assured it will be the last. I should have known better after being burned in the past when I ordered \"Castaway Cowboy\" and \"Blackbeard's Ghost\". Both of those two also came dressed like this version of Moon-Spinners. Disney, I have ordered my LAST DVD from you until you get your act together. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?"

The old man left his son much money and the factory. But the man spent all the money in nearly three years and at last he had to sell the factory for food and clothes. Another three years passed and he wanted to find work but he couldn't do anything. Nobody would use a man like him. The young man thought and thought. At last he found a way. He began to beg  from door to door. Most people in the town knew him well and few of them had a pity  on him. So he was often hungry. He had to leave the town and came to Toronto. In the city he began to pretend  that he couldn't speak. So he could beg some money and food. One day Henry was begging by the station when he met Mr. Cook, one of his father's friends.

The 58*f means we're multiplying 58 by \"f\", and the 62*f means we're multiplying 62 by \"f\". \n\nSo, let's simplify the equation: \n\n58*f - 62*f - 32 = 0 \n\nTo do this, we can combine the two terms that have \"f\" in them: \n\n(58 - 62)*f - 32 = 0 \n\n-4*f - 32 = 0 \n\nNow, we want to isolate \"f\" on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 32 to both sides: \n\n-4*f = 32 \n\nFinally, we can solve for \"f\" by dividing both sides by -4: \n\nf = -8 \n\nSo, the answer is that \"f\" needs to be -8 in order to make the equation true."

The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.\nProblem:Head: PersonX becomes flat<sep>Tail: transgender\nSolution:"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "No. The Tail \"transgender\" does not denote a step within the larger Head event \"PersonX becomes flat\". It is not an action or event related to the Head. Therefore, the answer is \"No\"."

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose if during anaphase sister chromatids split up happens, how will it affect HURTING mitosis to proceed normally.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?\nA:"

        "value": "If the sister chromatids split up during anaphase, it would disrupt the normal progression of mitosis. The separation of sister chromatids is a crucial step in ensuring that each daughter cell receives the correct number of chromosomes. If this process is disrupted, it could lead to an unequal distribution of chromosomes, which could result in genetic abnormalities or cell death. This perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of mitosis. Direct effects could include the failure of the spindle fibers to properly attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes, leading to an inability to separate the sister chromatids. Indirect effects could include the activation of cell cycle checkpoints that would halt the progression of mitosis until the issue is resolved. Overall, any disruption to the normal process of mitosis could have significant consequences for the health and viability of the cell."
