{"file": "orca_instruction_0_test.jsonl", "index": 99, "predicted": "The audio describes the stages of mitosis, including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The question asks about the effect of splitting sister chromatids during anaphase. The splitting of sister chromatids during anaphase would directly affect the separation of genetic material, preventing the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells. This would disrupt the normal progression of mitosis and potentially lead to errors in cell division.", "reference": "If the sister chromatids split up during anaphase, it would disrupt the normal progression of mitosis. The separation of sister chromatids is a crucial step in ensuring that each daughter cell receives the correct number of chromosomes. If this process is disrupted, it could lead to an unequal distribution of chromosomes, which could result in genetic abnormalities or cell death. This perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of mitosis. Direct effects could include the failure of the spindle fibers to properly attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes, leading to an inability to separate the sister chromatids. Indirect effects could include the activation of cell cycle checkpoints that would halt the progression of mitosis until the issue is resolved. Overall, any disruption to the normal process of mitosis could have significant consequences for the health and viability of the cell.", "evaluation": "Score: 4  \nExplanation: The predicted answer is relevant and accurately addresses the question about the effects of splitting sister chromatids during anaphase. It correctly identifies the disruption to mitosis and the potential consequences for cell division. However, it lacks some detail regarding the indirect effects and broader implications mentioned in the reference answer, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score."}
