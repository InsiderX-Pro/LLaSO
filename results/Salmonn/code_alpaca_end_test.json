Write the code for the program.\n3. Save the file with a .java extension.\n4. Open the Java Development Kit (JDK) and compile the program.\n5. Run the compiled program and input the three integers.\n6. The program will output the largest number among the three integers.\n\nHere is an example code for the program:\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class LargestNumber {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter three integers: \");\n        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();\n        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();\n        int num3 = scanner.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(\"The largest number is: \" + (num1 > num2 ? num1 : num2));\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the program prompts the user to enter three integers and then compares them to find the largest number.</s>"
