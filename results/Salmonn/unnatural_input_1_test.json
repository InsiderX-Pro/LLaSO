The height of each building is represented by the index of the row and the number of viewers is represented by the index of the column.\n\nWe can initialize the number of viewers for each building to 1, since the first building is always shorter than or equal to all other buildings.\n\nWe can then fill in the values of the 2D array using the following formula:\n```makefile\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    for j in range(1, n):\n        if i is shorter than or equal to j:\n            viewers[i][j] = viewers[i-1][j-1] + 1\n        else:\n            viewers[i][j] = viewers[i-1][j]\n```\nHere, `n` is the number of buildings.\n\nWe can then return the number of viewers for each building.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement this solution:\n```python\ndef count_viewers(heights):\n    n = len(heights)\n    viewers = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            if i is shorter than or equal to j:\n                viewers[i][j] = viewers[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                viewers[i][j] = viewers[i-1][j]\n    return viewers\n```\nWe can test this solution with the following code:\n```python\nheights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nresult = count_viewers(heights)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will output:\n```css\n[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]\n```\nThis confirms that the solution works correctly.</s>"
