Industrial processes: Certain industrial processes, such as cement production and refrigeration, release greenhouse gases like hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride.\n\n5. Transportation: Cars, trucks, airplanes, and other modes of transportation produce greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, through the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n6. Land use changes: Urbanization, land development, and other changes in land use can release stored carbon from the soil into the atmosphere.\n\n7.

The Capitol hosts an annual event called the Hunger Games, where a boy and a girl from each district are selected to fight to the death in an arena until there is only one survivor. The story follows the journey of Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers to participate in the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister.\n\nOn the other hand, Maze Runner, written by James Dashner, is set in a mysterious place called the Glade, where a group of teenage boys are trapped with no memory of their past lives. The only way out of the Glade is through a constantly changing Maze, which is home to deadly creatures called Grievers. The story follows the journey of Thomas, who appears in the Glade and along with the other boys, tries to figure a way out of the Maze.\n\nWhile both novels share similarities in their settings and themes, they differ in many ways, such as the challenges faced by the protagonists, the nature of their societies, and the overarching goals of the characters.

Over time, this can lead to the development of new species through a process called speciation.\n\nSpeciation is the emergence of new and distinct species from a single ancestral species. It can occur through various mechanisms, one of which is natural selection. When a population is divided into separate groups by a physical barrier or environmental change, the groups are exposed to different selective pressures. This could be different food sources, climates, predators, or mating habits. Over time, the two populations may evolve in different directions as natural selection favors different traits in each group.\n\nEventually, the genetic changes in each population accumulate to the point where individuals from the two groups can no longer interbreed and produce fertile offspring. At this point, the two populations are considered to be distinct species. The process of speciation through natural selection can take many generations, and it is often influenced by other factors such as genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation.\n\nSo, in summary, natural selection leads to speciation by favoring the development of different traits in populations that are geographically or ecologically isolated from one another. Over time, these differences accumulate and create reproductive barriers, leading to the formation of new and distinct species.", "evaluation": "Score: 1  \nExplanation: The predicted answer does not provide any relevant information or explanation regarding how natural selection leads to speciation.
