He had tried therapy and medication, but nothing seemed to work. That's when he decided to start exercising regularly.\n\nAt first, he found it hard to motivate himself to go to the gym. But as he continued to exercise, he started to feel better. He had more energy, he slept better, and he felt more confident.\n\nNate's experience is just one example of how physical activity can improve mental health.
