This problem can be solved using several algorithms, including the nearest neighbor algorithm.\n\nHere's an implementation of the nearest neighbor algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef nearest_neighbor(graph, start):\n    distances = [(0, start)]\n    while len(distances) > 0:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(distances)\n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            next_nodes = graph[current_node]\n            for node in next_nodes:\n                distance_to_next_node = current_distance + graph[current_node][node]\n                heapq.heappush(distances, (distance_to_next_node, node))\n    return visited\n\n# Example usage:\ngraph = {\n    'A': {'B': 5, 'C': 3},\n    'B': {'A': 5, 'D': 2},\n    'C': {'A': 3, 'E': 4},\n    'D': {'B': 2, 'E': 6},\n    'E': {'C': 4, 'D': 6}\n}\nstart = 'A'\nvisited = set()\nshortest_path = nearest_neighbor(graph, start)\nprint(shortest_path)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `nearest_neighbor` function that takes a weighted graph as input and returns a list of nodes that form the shortest possible path starting from the given node. The `graph` parameter should be a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are dictionaries representing the edges and their weights.\n\nIn this example, we define a simple weighted graph with five nodes (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`) and six edges. We then call the `nearest_neighbor` function with the start node `'A'` and print the resulting path.\n\nNote that this implementation uses a priority queue (`heapq.heappush()` and `heapq.heappop()`) to efficiently find the closest unvisited node in the graph. The algorithm works by starting at the given node and repeatedly adding the next unvisited node to the priority queue based on its distance from the current node.
