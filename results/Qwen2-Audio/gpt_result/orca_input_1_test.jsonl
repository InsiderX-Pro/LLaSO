It will also enable Nigerians to travel to more countries without the need for a visa, as many countries require a machine-readable passport for visa-free travel.\n\nThe new passport comes in two categories: the 32-page standard passport and the 64-page frequent traveler passport. The standard passport is suitable for individuals who travel occasionally, while the frequent traveler passport is designed for individuals who travel frequently for business or personal reasons.\n\nThe new passport is also equipped with a biometric data page, which contains the holder's personal information, photograph, and fingerprints. This feature will help to prevent identity theft and fraud, as it will be difficult for anyone to impersonate the passport holder.\n\nTo obtain the new passport, Nigerians are required to visit the Nigerian Immigration Service website to complete an online application form. They will then be required to attend an interview at a passport office to provide their biometric data and other necessary documents.\n\nOverall, the introduction of the new machine-readable passport is a positive development for Nigeria, as it will make travel easier and more convenient for Nigerians.
