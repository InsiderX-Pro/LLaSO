The amount of friction depends on several factors, including the type of surface and the force pressing the object against the surface. \n\nIn this case, Jason noticed that his ATV moved faster on the ice than the sand. This suggests that the ATV experienced less resistance while moving on ice compared to sand. Ice generally provides less resistance than sand due to its lower density and roughness, which means that it can slide over it more easily without getting stuck or slowing down as much.
