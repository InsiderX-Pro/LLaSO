It is designed with sharp-edged holes or blades that shred the food into small pieces. Therefore, the primary purpose of a grater is to grate food items, and it is commonly used for grating cheese. \n\nOption B) grate metal easily is incorrect because a grater is not designed to grate metal. Grating metal can damage the grater and make it unsafe for food use. \n\nIn summary, a grater is a kitchen tool used to grate food items, and it is best suited for grating cheese and other food items, but not for grating metal."

Examples include clams (Veneridae), oysters (Ostreidae), scallops (Pectinidae), squids (Teuthidae), cuttlefishes (Sepiidae), and octopuses (Octopodidae).\n\n3. Terrestrial Mollusks: Some species of mollusks have adapted to live on land or in brackish water near coastlines. Examples include land snails (Helicidae) and slugs (Arionidae).\n\nIn conclusion, mollusks exhibit remarkable adaptability by inhabiting different types of ecosystems around the world. Their wide range of habitats is due to their ability to survive in various conditions through evolutionary adaptations such as shell formation for protection against predators or changes in body structure for better locomotion on different surfaces."

The new passport is designed to meet international standards and is equipped with advanced security features to prevent fraud and identity theft.\n\nThe new passport is expected to make travel easier and more convenient for Nigerians, as it will allow for faster processing times at immigration checkpoints. It will also enable Nigerians to travel to more countries without the need for a visa, as many countries require a machine-readable passport for visa-free travel.\n\nThe new passport comes in two categories: the 32-page standard passport and the 64-page frequent traveler passport. The standard passport is suitable for individuals who travel occasionally, while the frequent traveler passport is designed for individuals who travel frequently for business or personal reasons.\n\nThe new passport is also equipped with a biometric data page, which contains the holder's personal information, photograph, and fingerprints. This feature will help to prevent identity theft and fraud, as it will be difficult for anyone to impersonate the passport holder.\n\nTo obtain the new passport, Nigerians are required to visit the Nigerian Immigration Service website to complete an online application form. They will then be required to attend an interview at a passport office to provide their biometric data and other necessary documents.\n\nOverall, the introduction of the new machine-readable passport is a positive development for Nigeria, as it will make travel easier and more convenient for Nigerians. It will also help to prevent identity theft and fraud, which is a growing concern in today's digital age."

If the man does not need the cotton for medical purposes, then we need to consider other options. The option \"pocket\" could be a possibility if the man carries cotton balls with him for personal hygiene or other reasons.\n\n3. The options \"south\" and \"Georgia\" are too broad and do not provide any specific information about where the man could find cotton balls. Therefore, we can eliminate these options.\n\n4. The option \"North Carolina\" is also too broad, but it is worth considering if the man is located in or near North Carolina. North Carolina is known for its cotton production, so it is possible that the man could find cotton balls at a local store or market.\n\n5.

The team's colors are red and white.\n\nThe club has experienced several changes throughout its history, including name changes such as Persekabupaten Surakarta (1946-1950) and Persib Surakarta (1994-2008). In 2009, they reverted back to their original name, Persebaya Surakarta.\n\nIn terms of achievements, Persebaya Surakarta has won two Liga Indonesia Premier Division titles (1987 and 2015), one Piala Indonesia cup (2012), and one Liga Indonesia First Division title (2011).\n\nTheir most successful period was during the late 1980s when they were led by coach Peter Rudolf Widodo who guided them to win three consecutive league titles from 1986 to 1988.\n\nAs for international competitions, they participated in AFC Cup twice but failed to progress beyond the group stage both times.\n\nRegarding player transfers, some notable players who have represented Persebaya include Bambang Pamungkas who later became an Indonesian national team captain; Dwi Cahyo Teguh who moved on to play for clubs like PSMS Medan and Persija Jakarta; and Muhammad Ridwan who joined Malaysian side Johor Darul Ta'zim after impressing with Persebaya during their run-in last season.\n\nOverall, while not being one of Indonesia's biggest or most successful clubs by any means, Persebaya Surakarta holds significance within local football circles due largely due its long history dating back over eighty years ago when it first formed as part of efforts towards promoting sports development amongst young people living within city limits at that time.\\n\\nReference(s):\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS_Surakarta"

They are perennial plants with thick creeping underground rhizomes and large, bulb-like leaves during the growing season. According to the phylogenetic analysis provided by the author, Pectisites belongs to the tribe Cichorieae within the subfamily Cichorioideae. This classification places it within the larger group known as the daisy family (Asteraceae), which includes many familiar plants such as sunflowers, daisies, and chrysanthemums.\n\nThe relationship between Pectisites and other genera within its tribe can be visualized using a phylogenetic tree. In this context, each branch represents a common ancestor shared by two or more genera. The length of each branch corresponds to how long ago these ancestors lived compared to modern times. By examining these relationships closely, researchers can gain insights into evolutionary history and understand how different species have diverged over time.\n\nIn conclusion, Pectisites is classified as a type of asteraceous plant due to its membership in the sunflower family (Asteraceae) specifically within the tribe Cichorieae."

Thirdly, we can infer that \"1634: The Baltic War\" was written before \"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\" since it is mentioned first and is described as being \"preceded by\" the latter book. \n\nAdditionally, we can gather that these books likely belong to a series or collection of related works, given that they are both identified by a year in their titles. The mention of a \"Bavarian Crisis\" also suggests that the books may be historical fiction or alternate history, as they appear to be set in a specific time period and involve political events. \n\nOverall, this sentence provides a brief introduction to two books by David Weber and hints at their genre and subject matter."
