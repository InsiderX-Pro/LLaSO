Helium is an inert gas that has various industrial applications.\n\nWood gas differs from these other gases in its production method and composition.

Chávez saw Cuba as an inspiration and role model for his own country's development.\n\nIn terms of economic cooperation, Cuba has benefited from Venezuela's vast oil reserves by receiving discounted petroleum products and technical assistance in exchange for medical services, education programs, and military training provided by Cuban personnel stationed in Venezuela.\n\nHowever, these relationships faced challenges during periods of political instability in both nations. For instance, following Hugo Chávez's death in 2013 and the subsequent rise of Nicolás Maduro as President of Venezuela, there were concerns about whether Maduro would be able maintain this close alliance with Cuba given his different leadership style compared to Chávez.\n\nDespite these uncertainties though it appears that both governments continue their efforts towards strengthening bilateral relations through ongoing collaboration across sectors such as healthcare delivery systems (Cuba sends doctors abroad), agriculture technology transfers (Venezuela shares expertise on organic farming methods), defense cooperation (joint exercises & training), among others.\n\nOverall then while there may be fluctuations based upon internal dynamics within each nation; overall trend suggests sustained engagement between Cuba & Venezuela despite external pressures from international community seeking regime change in Caracas' current administration.\\n\\nReference(s):\n- https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-venezuela-idUSBREA00000N20140714\n- https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/world/americas/venezuela-crisis-timeline.html", "reference": "RGB value of #e6e6fa is (230,230,250)", "evaluation": "Score: 1  \nExplanation: The predicted answer is completely irrelevant to the reference answer, which pertains to the RGB value of a color.
