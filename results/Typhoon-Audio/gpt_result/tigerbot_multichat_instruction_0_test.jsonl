It is homofermentative, microaerophilic, and ferments sugars into lactic acid. This helps prevent the drop of pH, which aids in its growth. L. acidophilus grows readily at low pH values (below pH 5.0) and has an optimum growth temperature of around 37 °C (99 °F). It is found in the human and animal gastrointestinal tract and mouth. Some strains may be considered to have probiotic characteristics and are commercially used in many dairy products.\n\nResearch has shown that feeding pigs with L.", "reference": "Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus acidophilus (New Latin 'acid-loving milk-bacillus') is a species of gram positive bacteria in the genus \"Lactobacillus\".", "evaluation": "Score: 4  \nExplanation: The predicted answer is highly relevant and accurate, providing detailed information about Lactobacillus acidophilus, including its characteristics and applications.
