It ensures the direction is between 0 and 359 degrees. Each clockwise rotation adds 90 degrees, while each counterclockwise rotation subtracts 90 degrees. The `assert` statement helps us check if the calculated direction matches the expected one, ensuring our code is correct. \n\nFinally, the `print` statements display the test case and the actual compass direction found.
