A mild injury might just cause some pain or discomfort, like a small strain or sprain. A moderate injury could involve more swelling, bruising, and maybe some loss of function, like being able to move a joint fully. A severe injury, on the other hand, can be quite serious, possibly causing broken bones, dislocations, or severe tears in muscles or ligaments. It's important to seek medical attention for any injury, but especially for moderate or severe ones to avoid further complications."
