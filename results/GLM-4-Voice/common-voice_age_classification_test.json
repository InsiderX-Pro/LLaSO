E.g., Millennials (early 1980s to mid-2000s) are often associated with technology use and social media.\n\n3. **age-related changes**: Physical, cognitive, and social changes that occur as people age. For example, memory might decline with age, but social skills could improve.\n\n4. **Life Stage Effects**: Differences in experiences or roles within a person's life. For example, young adults might focus on education and career, while older adults might prioritize retirement and healthcare.\n\n5. **Cultural Variations**: Differences in age groups within a society that reflect different cultural norms or values. For example, in some cultures, elders are respected for their wisdom, while in others,年轻人 might hold more influence.\n\nThese variations can impact everything from social behavior to economic trends."
