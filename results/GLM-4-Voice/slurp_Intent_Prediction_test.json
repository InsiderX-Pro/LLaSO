In reality, the Earth is likely to remain habitable for many millions of years, thanks to natural processes like plate tectonics and the sun's stable output. However, in the distant future, our sun will expand into a red giant and eventually consume the Earth, but that's not expected to happen for about 5 billion years. So, no need to worry about that just yet!"
