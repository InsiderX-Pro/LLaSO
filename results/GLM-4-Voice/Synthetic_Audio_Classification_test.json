They were originally a part of the Department of War, but in 1908, they transferred to the Justice Department. Their main job is to protect the president, vice president, their immediate families, and other designated folks. They're also involved in protective details for foreign heads of state visiting the U.S. The Secret Service has two main branches: the Uniformed Division and the Intelligence Division. The Uniformed Division does the actual protection, while the Intelligence Division gathers information to prevent threats. They use advanced technology and intelligence analysis to stay ahead of potential dangers. Plus, they train with the military and law enforcement to ensure they're ready for anything. And yes, they investigate financial crimes, like counterfeiting and credit card fraud, which is how they originally started. So, they're a diverse agency with many responsibilities, but their primary focus is protecting those in high office."
