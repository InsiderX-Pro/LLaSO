This is done to reduce competition with native bird species for resources like food and nesting sites. It's a controversial practice, with opponents arguing it's inhumane and ineffective."

    "result": "The difference between 'Sats Story of Self-Supporting Child' and 'Sorrow in the Heavens' lies in the tone and focus of each story. 'Sats Story of Self-Supporting Child' is often seen as optimistic and encouraging, focusing on the resilience and self-sufficiency of children. It celebrates their ability to overcome challenges and thrive on their own. In contrast, 'Sorrow in the Heavens' tends to be more melancholic and reflective, exploring themes of loss, grief, and the complexities of human emotions. It dives into the emotional journey of individuals, often focusing on the pain and sorrow experienced. So, while both stories deal with childhood experiences, they do so from distinct emotional perspectives."
