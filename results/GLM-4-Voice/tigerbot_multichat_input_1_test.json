Reptiles\n8. Mammals\n\nAnd here's a bit about each:\n\n- Trilobites were arthropods that lived in the ocean, starting around 5380 million years ago and dying out about 2502 million years ago.\n- Brachiopods are shellfish-related animals, found in marine environments, from about 5380 to 252 million years ago.\n- Corals are marine invertebrates that started around 5380 million years ago and are still around today.\n- Crustaceans, like shrimp and crabs, first appeared around 5380 million years ago.\n- Fish appeared around 5380 million years ago and are still diverse today.\n- Amphibians, like frogs and salamanders, first showed up around 416 million years ago.\n- Reptiles, including dinosaurs, first appeared around 320 million years ago.\n- Mammals first appeared around 200 million years ago.\n\nThis gives us a good idea of the timeline of life in Kentucky during the Paleozoic era!"
