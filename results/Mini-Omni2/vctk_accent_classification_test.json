    "result": "The rainbow is a natural phenomenon that has been formed by the interaction of sunlight and water droplets in the atmosphere. The process starts with sunlight being refracted, or bent, as it enters the Earth's atmosphere. This bending of light is then reflected off the inside surface of water droplets, creating a spectrum of colors. When these droplets come together, they release the light in the form of visible light, which is what we see as a rainbow. The colors appear in the following order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. This beautiful spectrum is a result of the dispersion of light by the gases and particles in the atmosphere."
