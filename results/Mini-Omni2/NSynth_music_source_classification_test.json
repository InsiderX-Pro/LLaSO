The frequency of a sound is directly related to its pitch. For example, a low frequency sound might have a pitch of 34 Hz, while a high frequency sound might have a pitch of 128 Hz.   Finally, compare the pitch, phase, and phase transitions of the components to determine if they are all part of the same frequency range. If they are, the signal is likely to be in a phase, and the sound is in a high frequency range. If they are in a low frequency range, the signal is in a low frequency range.

Synthetic sounds, on the other hand, are produced by the emission of sound waves through the use of specialized instruments or microphones that mimic the way sound travels through the air. Essentially, acoustic sound is the raw, natural sound produced by the human ear, while synthetic sounds are created using technology to mimic real-life sounds."

Electronic sounds, on the other hand, are often more powerful and can be more immersive, which is great for environments like concert venues or studios. Synthetic sounds might be more affordable and easier to produce, but they can be less natural and might be more noticeable. Consider the mood you want to create and the specific environment you'll be in to make the best choice."
