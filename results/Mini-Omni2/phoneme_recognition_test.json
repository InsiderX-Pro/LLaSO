The statistic highlights that London has a significant number of people who are unendurable, often due to factors like poor infrastructure and limited access to education and healthcare. This can lead to a higher proportion of people in the lower million, who are often in poor conditions and may not have the resources to meet their basic needs. This can impact the quality of life for those living in these regions."
