    "result": "Sure, I can do that. To solve this problem, we can use a recursive algorithm. We can start by checking if the length of the set is 0 or 1. If it is, we can return the set as it is. If not, we can loop through the set and check if the current word is equal to the word we are trying to find the longest word in. If it is, we can store the word in a variable and return it. If not, we can check if the word is longer than the word we are trying to find and store the word in a variable. We can repeat this process until we find the longest word in the set."
