This is because the ideal gas behaves in a predictable way under various conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and viscosity. In ideal conditions, the gas will move more easily and at a slower rate, leading to greater acceleration and higher velocities. This behavior is crucial for applications like rocket propulsion and in the design of engines and pumps."
