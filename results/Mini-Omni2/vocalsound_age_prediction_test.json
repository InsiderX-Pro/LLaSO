For adults, the progression from infancy to adulthood typically involves the development of the vocal cords, with the most significant development occurring in the 18-20 years. The development of the voice can vary widely among different age groups, but generally, adults have the longest vocalizations.

For the second part, (a + b) / 100, you would calculate (a + b) / 100, which equals 100. For the third part, (a + b) / 100, you would calculate (a + b) / 100, which equals 100. Finally, for the fourth part, (a + b) / 100, you would calculate (a + b) / 100, which equals 100. By summing up these values, you get the age of the speaker at 100 years old."

    "result": "I am a voice assistant and cannot write code. To solve this problem, you can start by collecting a dataset of human vocalizations. Once you have this data, you can preprocess it by normalizing the frequencies of the voices. Then, you can select a machine learning model, such as a recurrent neural network or a transformer, which is good at handling large volumes of audio data. Train the model on your preprocessed data, and validate its performance with a separate dataset to check for accuracy. Finally, fine-tune the model parameters to improve its performance."
