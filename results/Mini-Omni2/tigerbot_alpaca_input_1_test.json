Sam decided to take Whiskers to the vet, where she was diagnosed with a skin condition. The vet prescribed a new shampoo and recommended a new coat, both of which were made entirely of the fluffy, white material Sam had helped Sam with. With Whiskers' help, Sam's dog's coat was changed to look as beautiful as new.
