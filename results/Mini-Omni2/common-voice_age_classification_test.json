Jam, on the other hand, has a higher citric acid content, which can help balance your body's pH levels and is often used for its tangy flavor. If you enjoy the taste of honey and prefer a less processed option, jam might be the way to go. If you're looking for a more natural option with a longer shelf life, honey could be the better choice.
