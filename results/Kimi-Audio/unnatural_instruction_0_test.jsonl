Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Compass Directions:**\n   - The compass directions are: North (N), East (E), South (S), and West (W).\n   - The rotations are either clockwise (1) or counterclockwise (2).\n\n2. **Determine the Effect of Each Rotation:**\n   - Clockwise rotation (1): The direction moves to the next direction in the sequence: N -> E -> S -> W -> N.\n   - Counterclockwise rotation (2): The direction moves to the previous direction in the sequence: N -> W -> S -> E -> N.\n\n3. **Implement the Solution:**\n   - We will use a list to represent the compass directions.\n   - We will iterate through the rotations and update the current direction accordingly.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_compass(direction, rotation):\n    compass = ['N', 'E', 'S', 'W']\n    if rotation == 1:\n        # Clockwise rotation\n        direction = compass[(compass.index(direction) + 1) % 4]\n    elif rotation == 2:\n        # Counterclockwise rotation\n        direction = compass[(compass.index(direction) - 1) % 4]\n    return direction\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        D = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        current_direction = 'N'\n        for _ in range(N):\n            current_direction = rotate_compass(current_direction, D)\n        \n        print(current_direction)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Input Reading:**\n   - The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` and split into a list of strings.\n   - The first element is the number of test cases `T`.\n\n2. **Main Loop:**\n   - For each test case, the number of rotations `N` and the direction `D` are read.\n   - The current direction is initialized to 'N'.\n   - The `rotate_compass` function is called for each rotation, updating the current direction.\n\n3. **Output:**\n   - The final direction after all rotations is printed.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the rotations and ensures that the compass direction is updated correctly for each test case."}

The cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine similarity is used when the magnitude of the vectors is irrelevant and only their direction matters.\n\nFirst, we need to represent A, B, and C as vectors. Let's assume that we have a dataset of people and their features, such as age, height, weight, etc. We can represent each person as a vector of their features. For example, if we have three features (age, height, weight), we can represent A as [25, 170, 60], B as [30, 180, 70], and C as [20, 160, 50].\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cosine similarity between A and B, and between A and C. The cosine similarity is calculated as follows:\n\ncosine_similarity = (A dot B) / (||A|| * ||B||)\n\nwhere A dot B is the dot product of A and B, and ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of A and B, respectively.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the cosine similarity between A and B as follows:\n\nA dot B = (25 * 30) + (170 * 180) + (60 * 70) = 7500\n||A|| = sqrt(25^2 + 170^2 + 60^2) = 187.08\n||B|| = sqrt(30^2 + 180^2 + 70^2) = 200.99\ncosine_similarity = 7500 / (187.08 * 200.99) = 0.20\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the cosine similarity between A and C as follows:\n\nA dot C = (25 * 20) + (170 * 160) + (60 * 50) = 5500\n||A|| = sqrt(25^2 + 170^2 + 60^2) = 187.08\n||C|| = sqrt(20^2 + 160^2 + 50^2) = 170.78\ncosine_similarity = 5500 / (187.08 * 170.78) = 0.18\n\nFinally, we can compare the cosine similarities and declare the most similar person to A. In this case, B is more similar to A than C, since the cosine similarity between A and B is higher than the cosine similarity between A and C. Therefore, B is the most similar person to A using the cosine similarity metric."}

The recipe is divided into two main parts: the preparation of the batter and the baking of the cake.\n\nFirst, the recipe instructs the user to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). This is an important step as it ensures that the oven is at the correct temperature before the cake is placed inside. The user should allow the oven to preheat for at least 10-15 minutes before proceeding with the recipe.\n\nNext, the recipe instructs the user to cream together the butter, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl. This step is important as it ensures that the ingredients are well combined and the mixture is smooth and creamy. The user should use an electric mixer or a wooden spoon to cream the ingredients together until they are well combined.\n\nAfter the ingredients have been creamed together, the recipe instructs the user to combine the flour mixture with the creamed mixture alternately with milk. This step is important as it ensures that the cake batter is well mixed and that the flour is fully incorporated into the mixture. The user should add the flour mixture and milk alternately, starting and ending with the flour mixture.\n\nFinally, the recipe instructs the user to mix the batter until it is well blended. This step is important as it ensures that the cake batter is smooth and free of lumps. The user should use an electric mixer or a wooden spoon to mix the batter until it is well blended.\n\nOnce the batter is prepared, the recipe instructs the user to pour the batter into a greased and floured cake pan. The user should allow the cake to bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. The user should allow the cake to cool before removing it from the pan and serving it.\n\nOverall, the instructions provided for the cake recipe are clear and can be followed by someone who has never made that specific type of cake before. The recipe is well-structured and provides all the necessary information to ensure that the cake is made correctly and results in a desired outcome."}
