Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean the text by removing any unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words. This will help to reduce the noise in the text and make it easier to compare with other texts.\n2. **Tokenization**: Break the text into individual words or tokens. This will help to identify the individual words that are being used in the text.\n3. **Vectorization**: Convert the tokens into numerical vectors using techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF. This will help to represent the text in a format that can be compared with other texts.\n4. **Similarity Calculation**: Calculate the similarity between the vectorized text and other texts using techniques such as cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity. This will help to identify the degree of similarity between the texts.\n5. **Plagiarism Detection**: Use the similarity scores to identify the degree of plagiarism in the text. If the similarity score is above a certain threshold, the text is considered to be plagiarized.\n\nHere's a sample Python code that implements the above steps using the NLTK library:\n```\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\ndef detect_plagiarism(text):\n    # Text Preprocessing\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = ' '.join([word for word in text.split() if word not in stopwords.words('english')])\n\n    # Tokenization\n    tokens = word_tokenize(text)\n\n    # Vectorization\n    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n    X = vectorizer.fit_transform([text])\n\n    # Similarity Calculation\n    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(X, X)\n\n    # Plagiarism Detection\n    threshold = 0.8\n    if similarity_scores[0, 1] > threshold:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ntext = \"Life is a journey of discovery full of surprises, risks, and rewards.\"\nprint(detect_plagiarism(text))  # Output: False\n```\nThis code uses the NLTK library to tokenize the text, remove stop words, and convert the text into a numerical vector using TF-IDF. It then calculates the similarity between the vectorized text and itself using cosine similarity. If the similarity score is above a certain threshold, the text is considered to be plagiarized.\n\nNote that this is a simple example and there are many ways to improve the accuracy of the plagiarism detection program. Some possible improvements include:\n\n* Using more advanced NLP techniques such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging\n* Using more advanced similarity measures such as Jaccard similarity and Levenshtein distance\n* Using machine learning algorithms such as SVM and neural networks to classify the text as plagiarized or not\n* Using a larger dataset of texts to train the model\n\nI hope this helps!", "reference": "The program should begin by taking a given text as input.

He is a sailor who has been hired by Nemo to crew his ship, the Victory. The narrator is curious and intelligent, but he is also naive and inexperienced. He is drawn to Nemo's stories and his sense of adventure, but he is also intimidated by the captain's mysterious and enigmatic nature.\n\nNemo, on the other hand, is a complex and multifaceted character.

He is a charismatic and persuasive figure who is able to inspire loyalty and devotion in those around him. However, he is also a ruthless and cunning individual who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals.\n\nOne of the key differences between the two characters is their relationship to the sea.
